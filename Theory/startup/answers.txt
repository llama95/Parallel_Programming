1. Mooreâ€™s law says that the number of transistors that can be integrated on a chip will double approximately every two years. This is relevant to computing because it means that as time continues to pass our processors will continue to increase their performance allowing us to in turn also increase our performance by having our code processed at a faster rate.
2. Processor clock speed is relevant because it measures the performance of a CPU by calculating the number of clock cycles performed per second. Although the 1ghz cpu has a better clock speed, the other cpu could have many more cores, giving it better performance/less power usage.
3. FLOPS - Strength: Follows a standardized formula to calculate the capability of computing speed, is reliable and works well with large number based written code. Weakness: you need to have the precise execution time of the alogorithm, number of floating point operations in your algorithm, and all pieces to of the formula to calculate FLOPS. 
IOPS - Strengths: Measures input/output per second performance of computer storage devices.
Weaknesses: The IOPS performance number can greatly change based on workload (I/O size,I/O stream) and does not  correspond  to real world performance.
Time - Strengths: Measures capability by calculating how long it takes it takes to process some volume of data/bits. Uses a raw calculation of clock speed to find the exact processing time.
Weakness: If 2 machines have the same  clock speed but a different amount of cores, the one with more cores will be more efficient. Comparing computer capability via time/clock speed does not take this measure into account.
